<h3>Hello my name is Julio I come from a family of four including myself, my parents were immigrants who came here during the Reagan administration. I grew up around computers because of my godfather's job was on that area at the age of 4 I remember drawing lines in MIcrosoft Paint and filling in the between the lines feeling like Picasso. In highschool I would often jailbreak the iPhones of my colleagues. I like to take photos sometimes and take long walks not at the beach but maybe a botanical garden. I joined year up as an alternative to college as I did not vibe the idea of going to an institution for 4 years and studying both materials you do care and do not care about. I decided to join the DBA track here at year up bellevue. What I hope to do next is try to earn an internship in web development. or an other area where I can code.</h3>
